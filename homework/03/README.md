# Homework 3 - SofaScore Frontend Academy

This homework is more creative then previous one. There is only one task: create new page with Pokemon from the [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/).

There is no need for you to clone this to your repository, just open new branch and start coding. Once you've finished open PR and request review from me.

Try to utilize Slack and feel free to ask for help, explanation, advice, ...

## Requirements

Everyone should implement these features:

- Fetch Pokemon from API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/)
- Display Pokemon on screen (use list, not table).
- User should be able to remove any Pokemon from the list

## Creative freedom

If you want to add some extra functionality to your Pokemon page, feel free to do so, I would be glad. If you hate Pokemon, you can use some other API, just make sure that there is route that returns collection of items.

If you want to extend functionality you could borrow some of my ideas:

- Implement pagination to extend pokemon list
- Return deleted Pokemon to list
- Create accordion list, which on expand reveals Pokemon info (render list, on list item click open info about that Pokemon)
