## Homework 5 - SofaScore Frontend Academy

Goal of this homework is exploring React Hooks. This homework will be later reused as part of the final project.

## React project setup

We will use Create React App, just like in previous homework. [Instructions for CRA initialization in previous homework](https://github.com/MSekrst/sofascore-academy-2020/tree/master/homework/04#react-project-setup).

## Task

## Help

If you need help with homework, have trouble wrapping your head around some concept we've covered in lessons also feel free to contact me and we will clarify any confusions.

I would also want to remind you to submit your PRs earlier, so your homework can iterate more (there will be time for multiple code reviews, 1 on 1 video reviews, etc.).
