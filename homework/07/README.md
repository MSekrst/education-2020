# Homework 7 - SofaScore Frontend Academy

Goal of this homework is exploring Redux. There is one simple task: create an app with React and Redux.
Choose app domain as you like, there is no need for an API (you can use fake API from JS files just like I did in web shop app).

To really explore Redux features try to implement these features:

- Have list of items in Redux
- Use this list in more places throughout the app
  (just like I did with shopping items: I used them in main list and I used them in the shopping cart)
- Add some kind of list filtering (show only part of the list, or something similar), keep filter in Redux
- Modify list items (e.g. change 1 item in Redux and then watch how item would be updated in whole app)
- Persist Redux state for repeated visits (I added state persist to web shop app;
  When user leaves page state will be saved and on new arrival saved state will be used)

This list contains some challenges, where Redux can be really useful.
There are other use cases where Redux shines, if you find one feel free to implement it.

## Note

This list is informative. Try to implement some items from it, it is totally up to you which feature(s).
If you want to explore Redux in other direction feel free to do so.
I don't expect all these features in a single application as that could possibly be more time consuming then necessary.
You can choose level of difficulty for this homework based on your other activities, only goal is to try out Redux.

## Project related work

If you wish to concentrate more on the project you can implement this homework with your project domain (e.g. implement leagues list or events list). API is not needed yet as we haven't covered Async action (we will next time), so use plain object to mimic API response. Result of this homework should be presentation components that will be used in you Project app.
