# Introduction

- Multi-paradigm language (Procedural, Object-Oriented, Functional)
- Backward compatible (not forward compatible)
- Implementation of the ECMAScript standard, TC39 Committee
- Core technology of the Web

<Notes>

- Multi-paradigm -> choice is on programmer, mix of concepts
- Backward compatible -> old code can run on newer versions
- Forward compatible -> new code can run on older versions (We need tools to [**transpile**](https://babeljs.io/) new code to old platforms)
- TC39 -> committee responsible for ECMA standards -> Major companies (Google, Apple), device manufacturers (Samsung), etc.

# History - 1994.

- Web pages are booming
- Netscape Navigator is most popular web browser
- Pages are static -> people want dynamic pages
 
---

# History - 1995.

- Embedding Java into browsers -> <span style={{ color: "red" }}>FAIL</span>
- [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) created LiveScript
- LiveScript shipped as JavaSript in Netscape Navigator -> <span style={{ color: "green" }}>SUCCESS</span>
- Microsoft IE -> JScript -> reverse engineered JavaScript

<Notes>

  - JavaScript was marketing trick designed to attract Java programmers, Java is hot at the time
  - Today Oracle owns "JavaScript" trademark, but doesn't enforce it. That is the reason why official name of the language is ECMAScript
  - JScript -> reverse engineering discovered JS bugs and quirks which were also present in JScript

</Notes>

--- 

# History - Rest

- ECMA standardization (1996.)
- Microsoft IE has 95% market cap -> standardized bugs from JScript
- Mozilla Firefox (2004.)
- Ajax (2005.)
- Google Chrome (2008.)
- ECMA2009 (ES5)
- ECMA2015 (ES6)

<Notes>

- standardized bugs are in language to this date (e.g. type of `null` is object)
- AJAX -> set of tecnologies to load and display web data in background (Asynchronous)
- Chrome -> JIT Compilation (significant speedup)
- [ES5](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es5.asp) -> strict mode, array methods, JSON methods, ...
- [ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) -> arrow functions, classes, `let`, `const`, ...
- Latest JS specification today is ES2019 (ES10) -> yearly relase plan

</Notes>

# JavaScript engines

- Key part of a browser
- Runs JavaScript code 
  - compile
  - optimize
- V8 (Chrome & Node), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), Nitro (Safari)

<Notes>

Two key functions of an engine:
- compile -> JIT compilation was game changer in 2008. -> now all browsers implement JIT compiler
- optimize -> Code optimization -> [More on V8 optimizations](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-javascript-works-optimizing-the-v8-compiler-for-efficiency/)

# JavaScript Basics

- C like syntax (`if`, `switch`, `while`)
- Dynamically typed
- Types (`typeof` operator):
  - primitive: `number`, `boolean`, `string`, `undefined`
  - complex: `object`, `null`, `function`
- Variables:
  - `var` -> function scope, reassignable
  - `let` -> block scope, reassignable
  - `const` -> block scope, cannot be reassigned

<Notes>

-  Falsy values (false, 0, `''`, `null`, `undefined`)
- `var` is global when used outside the function
- `let` and `const` came with ES2015 and are commonly used

</Notes>

# Example - Hello World

```js
  console.log('Hello', 'World')
```

</Invert>

<Notes>

- `console.log()` function is not specified in ECMA specification -> developers use utility functions of a desired platform (e.g. all browsers have console.log implementation, event Node has one). 
Browsers expose `window` top level object which contains console.log function. Node has `global` top level object with utility functions. General rule is that platform top level object can be omitted (use `console.log()` instad of `window.console.log()`).
Please note that each top level object has its' own utilities, so calling non existant utility function will result in an error.
- Where are ; -> JS has automatic semicolon injection (ASI), so if you miss one it will be inserted and program would run. 
ASI will try to add semicolon after: line terminator (`\n`), block ending bracket (`}`), end of the file, specific grammar places (after `return`, `break`).
Semicolon will be inserted only if line is incorrect without semicolon. If line has no errors and next line also follows JS grammar then semicolon will not be inserted (**EDGE CASE**)

</Notes>

<Invert>

# Example - ASI

```js
function bar() {
  1 + 1 // no semi
  -1 + 1 === 0 ? console.log(0) : console.log(2)
}

```

</Invert>

<Notes>

- Semicolon here changes evaluation (without semicolon -> lines are merged into one)
- Note ternary operator -> very useful later with React

</Notes>

# Example - Types

```js
console.log(typeof 2) // number
console.log(typeof 'SFA') // string
console.log(typeof { foo: 'bar' }) // object
console.log(typeof [1, 2, 3]) // object -> not array!
console.log(typeof (() => {})) // function -> this is arrow function
console.log(typeof null) // object -> JScript bug!
console.log(typeof NaN) // number -> Not a number is a number :)
```

# Type Coercion

- Process of converting value from one type to another
- Happens implicitly (e.g. `==` instead of `===`)

<Notes>

- Double equal checks variables by value -> if types arent the same then it will coerce values to a common type. [Detailed coercion rules](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/js-type-coercion-explained-27ba3d9a2839/)
- Triple equal won't allow coercion and will return false if types are different, and true only if types and values are the same
- Always use triple equal (enforce it if you can)

</Notes>

## Example - Coercion

</Invert>

<Notes>

[Detailed explanation with more memes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/explaining-the-best-javascript-meme-i-have-ever-seen/)

1. **number** and **string** coerce to **number** (call ToNumber('0'))
2. **number** and **array**(object) coerce to **number** (call ToPrimitve([]) -> number representation of an array is length of course)
3. **string** and **array**(object) coerce to **string** (call ToPrimitve([]) -> string representation of an array are its elements divided with comma)

- Fun examples:
  - `0 == {}` => `false` 
  - `false == new Boolean(false)` => `true`, but `false === new Boolean(false)` => `false` 

</Notes>

# Example - Plus Sign

- Concatenating strings, adding numbers
- If number and string -> coerce number to string

```js
console.log(2 + 4) // 6
console.log('Sofa' + 'Score') // SofaScore
console.log(2 + 4 + 'Score') // 6Score
console.log('Sofa' + 2 + 4) // Sofa24
```

</Invert>

# Objects

- Most important structure in JavaScript
- Collection of named values
  - values can be of any type (even function)
- **MUTABLE**
- Creation:
  - `new Object`
  - `Object.create`
  - `{ foo: 'bar' }` -> most used

<Notes>

- Functions can be used as value, and stored in variables. This allows some cool patterns such as object methods, encapsulation, ...
- Mutable -> adding or changing property of an object doesn't change object (it's reference stays the same) -> **IMPORTANT for React**
- `Object.create` -> creates new object from existing object if provided as argument -> used for inheritance
- Curly braces (Object literal) are most used for object creation because it results in cleanest code. 

</Notes>

---

# This 

- Reference to object it belongs to
- Used in functions, to access properties of an owner (similar to Java)

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "Sofa",
  lastName : "Score",
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + this.lastName; // SofaScore
  }
};
```

<Notes>

- Java methods have `this` and `this` is reference to an instance on which method is called. 
In JavaScript funtions have this. If global function is called (without owner), `this` referrs to global object (`window`, `global`)

</Notes>

# Example - This or That

# Functions

- Can be pictured as `Object`
- Function Declaration
  - `function doSomething() { ... }`
- Function Expression
  - `const doSomething = function() { ... }`
- Arrow functions
  - `const return2020 = () => 2020`
  - `function` and `return` can be avoided
  - no `this`
- IIFE -> Immediately Invoking Function Expression

<Notes>

- Function as objects -> has properties, methods, even have object prototype (e.g. `console.log insanceof Object` is `true`)
- Two most common ways of function creation, slight difference is in hoisting (explained later)
- Arrow functions are commonly used, return is often omitted to improve readability. They don't change `this`, so there is no need for `that`.
- IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) -> historically used to provide encapsulation for variables (`var`). 
Code was wrapped in function that was called after definition, and variables from that code were scoped to function and not visible from outside.

# Example - Function Arguments

</Invert>

<Notes>

- `call by value` or `call by reference` mode depends on operations performed on arguments inside the function

# Prototype inheritance

- Mechanism by which JS objects inherit features
- Propotype chain -> chain of prototypes for an object (all accessible)
- Most OO languages -> class inheritance

<Notes>

- Prototype chain -> list of inherited prototypes starting from more specific to more general. If object doesn't have property or function then look in its prototype.
If more specific prototype doesn't contain searched property or function, go into next, more generic prototype, ...
- All prototypes end with object prototype -> "Object is the king in JavaScript"
- `instanceof` operator tests if object has some prototype in its chain (e.g. function is instance of object)

</Notes>

import arrayProto from './images/arrayProto.png'

<img className="big-image" alt="Array prototype chain" src={arrayProto} />

<Notes>

- List of all array methods -> useful for later
- Note how array has its own prototype, and then its prototype has object prototype
- `constructor` method is called with `new` keyword

</Notes>

<Invert>

# Example - Prototypes

</Invert>

<Notes>

- Note how prototypes and functions make classic inheritance possible, they even extend possiblities (dynamic prototype change)

</Notes>


---

# Classes

- Classes are type of functions
- Cleaner and more familiar syntax 
  - `constructor` function
  - `static` methods 
  - `extends` and `super`

<Notes>

- Classes are actually functions -> functions are objects -> all classes can be written as objects
- Class syntax is similar to other OO languages (Java)
- Classes can have getters and setters too (`get` and `set` keywords)

</Notes>

# Hoisting

- Process of moving all **DECLARATIONS** to the top of a file
- Hoisted:
  - Function declarations (`function() {...}`)
  - `var` variables
- Not Hoisted:
  - Function expresions (`const a = () => {}`)
  - `const` and `let` variables
  - classes

---

<Invert>

# Example - Hoisting

```js
x = 'X'

console.log({ x, y }) // { x: 'X', y: undefined }

var x
var y = 'Y'
```

</Invert>

<Notes>

- Declarations are hoisted (`var x`), not definitions (`x = 'X'`)

</Notes>

---

# Closure

- Functions are bundled with references to surrounding state (Lexical Environment)
- Inner function can access outer function scope **even after** outer function has finished its execution
- Makes encapsulation possible
