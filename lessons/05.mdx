## React.js - Hooks

# React Performance

- Browser DOM is slow and inconsistent
- Reuse DOM
- SyntheticEvent
  - Browser universal event wrapper
  - Pooled
  - Reused

<Notes>

- DOM is slow because it is large date structure(tree) that has to be modified and traversed. 
Removing elements and inserting new ones is costly because all children have to be removed and inserted again.
DOM implementation can be different between multiple browser vendors (inconsistent returns, method names, ...)
- React will try to reuse as much DOM as possible (remove and add only necessary elements, minimize DOM navigation).
- SyntheticEvent - All DOM events in React are wrapped in SyntheticEvent wrapper. SyntheticEvent has all properties of native browser event (`target`, `currentTarget`, `stopPropagation`, `preventDefault`, ...).
SyntheticEvent guarantees same event structure in all browsers and takes care of inconsistencies. 
SyntheticEvent is event agnositc (works with any event) and it can be pooled and reused for any event. 
React has pools of SyntheticEvents to avoid event creation, which makes runtime performant, 
but developers have to be careful not to reference SyntheticEvent properties directly, or perform async work on event instance, 
because after event lifetime, event will return to pool and its properties will be reset to null.

# Virtual DOM

- Virtual representation of UI in memory
- Abstracts DOM manipulations, event handling
- Synced with real DOM -> **reconciliation**

<Notes>

- React will make all changes and calculations on efficient Virtual DOM. Once Virtual DOM is finished, React will calculate diff with real DOM to find needed changes (minimal set).
Those minimal changes will be made.
- Virtual DOM is responsible for all DOM manipulations. It will also comunicate DOM changes to browser. All Virtual DOM tasks are performed by `reactDOM` library.
`reactDOM` is connection between `react` and browser (`react` is platform agnostic, it will work in browser, on mobile phones, on servers, antwhere where JS would work). 
Target platform is determined by wrapper library (`reactDOM` -> browser, server; `react-native` -> Mobile Apps)
- Reconciliation - process of syncing virtual and real DOM.

</Notes>

# Reconciliation algorithm

- Assumptions:
  - Two elements of different type will produce different trees.
  - Developer can hint which child elements are stable across renders (`key` prop)
- Determines component lifecycle (update, mount, unmount)

<Notes>

- Assumptions: If we change element type (div -> span) tree will be different and it should be replaced (remove old, insert new tree). 
Don't change element type if not necessary.
Use `key` prop to mark stable elements. Stable elements can be reused if `key` stays the same. 
Don't change keys if not necessary and don't switch keys between two elements (especially of the same type, e.g. `div` ).
- If element rerenders -> update lifecycle will be called (`getDerivedStateFromProps`, `render`, `componentDidUpdate`), state is preserved.
- If element is removed and inserted -> unmount and mount lifecycles will be called (`componentWillUnmount`, `constructor`, `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `render`, `componentDidMount`), state is not preserved.
- [Reconciliation in details](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)

</Notes>

# Performance - Developers

- Minimize expensive DOM operations -> follow reconciliation rules
- **Minimize number of unnecessary rerenders**
- When will rerender happen:
  - Prop change - (prop value or reference)
  - State change
  - `this.forceUpdate()`
  - When parent rerenders

<Notes>

- Avoid unnecessary expensive DOM operations (replacing elements).
- Rerenders can be slow (big lists, lot of elements, ...) and cause UX problems (flickering, mistimed animations, ...).
React will try its best to preserve DOM structure, so rerenders could be cheap (if there are no DOM changes).
Developers should know when components should rerender and how to avoid unnecessary rerenders.
Component will rerender if:
  1. Props change -> Props with new value should rerender, props with new reference could avoid rerender (if object reference changes, object can still have same properties -> no need to rerender).
  Just be cautius when diffing, as diff process can take longer then rerender.
  2. State change -> Few valid use-cases when state change doesn't need rerender. If state change doesn't need rerender it's often sign of bad state architecture (part of state should be ordinary variable, or prop)
  3. When `this.forceUpdate()` called -> Used for complex multistep animations (could be replaced with carfully crafted state).
  4. When parent rerenders -> Common performance problem. When parent rerenders, all its children will also rerender, and those rerenders could possibly be avoided. This problem is solved with component arhitecture: keep changes as deep in tree as possible. Rerenders deeper in the tree will trigger fewer rerenders than those up the tree.

# Functional Programming

- Computation is evaluation of functions
- Immutable data
- Pure functions
- No side effects
- High order functions - take other functions as arguments
- Benefits:
  - Reduced complexity
  - Testability

<Notes>

- In FP everything should be expressed as function.
- Immutable data -> Program data cannot be mutated in any way and there are no state changes. JavaScrpt has `Object.freeze` method and various libraries (e.g. `immutable.js`)
- **Pure Function** - function that always returns same output for the same input. 
Function is pure if it depends only on function arguments, which are not mutated in any way (read only).
Pure function has no side effects and can be replaced with its output.
- Side Effects - changes in system caused by some function (memory, network, I/O). Side effects are fetch requests, file system interactions, variable mutations, ...
- Reduced complexity - functions are easier to understand as they are more predictable
- Testability - pure functions are easiliy unit tested, just test input - output pairs (as they should always be same)

</Notes>

---

# Pure Function - Example

```js
function circleCircumference(radius) {
  return radius * Math.PI
}

function circleCircumferencePure(radius, PI) {
  return radius * PI
}

circleCircumferencePure(5, Math.PI)
```

<Notes>

- Common mistake is usage of language constants, they influence input, so they must be passed as argument.

</Notes>

# Functional Components

- Simple React components
- Function: `(props) => Markup`
- Can be imagined as class component with only render method

<Notes>

- Used in simple use cases where state or life cycle methods aren't needed
- Functional components can be imagines as only `render` method of class components

</Notes>

# Functional Component - Example

```react
function Button({ children, value, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button value={value} onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

# React Hooks

- Extend capabilities of functional components
  - Add class component features
- Can add state, side effects, memoization
- Rules: 
  - Always same number of hooks
  - Only in top level of functional component
  - Dependency array
- Prefixed with `use*`
- Component can have multiple hooks of same type

<Notes>

- Allow functional components to replace class components, as class components could be deprecated in later versions of React.
- Hooks enforce some rules:
  - Component should always have same number of hooks across (re)renders. Developers shouldn't add hooks conditionaly or return before all hooks were called.
  - Hooks can only be specified in top level of functional component. Developers should add hooks only in main component block. Hooks cannot be added in `if` or any other block (`for`, `switch`) 
  - All hooks have dependency array (except `useState` hook which runs on every state change). Dependency array determines when should hook rerun. 
  If variable in dependency array changes, hook will rerun, if empty dependency array is provided, hook will never rerun.
- Multiple hooks of same type can be used to enable developers to write SRP compatible functions and provide differrent dependency arrays for different hooks of same type.

</Notes>

---

# `useState`

- Adds state to functional component
- Whole state must be always set
  - Provide whole next state not only changes
- No dependency array 
  - Has explicit setter for state change
- **`const [state, setState] = React.useState(initialState)`**

<Notes>

- Encapuslate state in functional components
- Difference with `setState`: `setState` will merge new state with existing state, so developers can provide only changes.
 Hook setter won't merge provided new state with existing state, new state will be anything developer provides to setter.

</Notes>

# `useEffect`

- Perform side effects in functional components 
- Run some code on component update
- Can return function (Cleanup function)
  - Cleanup will be called when component is unmounted
  - Cleanup will be called before next rerun
- `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount` in one
- `useEffect(() => { /* do something */ }, [/* dependency array */])`

<Notes>

- Side effects are effects observed from outside of a function (fetch request, event listeners, timers).
- `useEffect` is used to make side effects on each update (or when variables in dependency array change).
- Effect function can return cleanup function, which is called on unmount or before next rerun. 
Cleanup function is useful when developers have to remove event listeners, clear timers, etc. 
If cleanup wouldn't be called before rerun, listeners or timers would be duplicated, so before next rerun, cleanup is called to remove previous listeners or timers.

</Notes>

# `useMemo`

- Used to memoize **value** of some operation
- Memoize expensive operations
- No side effects -> use `useEffect`
- No guarantees that function will not rerun with same input
- `const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeSomething(a, b), [a, b]);`

<Notes>

- Memoize return value for input argument, useful for expensive operations and calculations.
- Shouldn't perform side effects
- Can't guarantee that memoized value won't be removed from memory and recaluclated.

</Notes>

<Invert>

# `useMemo` - Example

</Invert>

---

# `useCallback`

- Used to memoize function (Not function result)
- Memoize handlers passed as props to avoid reference changes to handlers
- `const callback = useCallback(() => { /* do something */ }, [ /* dependencies */ ])`
- `useCallback(fn, deps)` is equivalent to `useMemo(() => fn, deps)`

<Notes>

- Memoizes function without excuting it, while `useMemo` executes function and memoizes value.
- Used to memoize handlers to avoid new handler reference on each render -> causes unnecessary rerenders where handler is passed as prop
- `useCallback` can be written as `useMemo` where function returns memoized handler.
