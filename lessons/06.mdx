# Lesson 6

## React.js - Advanced Concepts

# React Concepts (Patterns)

- React patterns for solving common problems:
  - Wrapping elements
  - Prop drilling
  - Logic reusablity

<Notes>

- React empowers developers to solve common problems when building web apps. Those problems are:
  - Every component must have exactly one top level element (most common is `div`). In some cases that wrapping can break styles.
  - Prop drilling -> Anti-pattern where props are passed through component tree (e.g. parent sends handler deeper down tree, more then few levels).
  - Logic is bound to components with presentation and as such is hardly reusable.

</Notes>

---

# React Fragment

- Can be used to wrap elements in the single element
- Won't top level element (Fragment) to the DOM
- Long (`<React.Fragment>`) and short (`<>`) syntax
  - Short syntax can't have props (even `key`)

<Notes>

- Commonly used in React codebases.
- Fragment has no DOM representation and will be omitted from the DOM -> won't effect styles and hierarchies.
- Short syntax is more used, but it can't take props (even `key`) so it should be avoided as top element for list items,
  where `key` is necessary (use long syntax there).

</Notes>

---

# React Fragment Usage

### Long syntax

```react
<React.Fragment>
  <h1>HELLO</h1>
</React.Fragment>
```

### Short syntax

```react
<>
  <h1>HELLO</h1>
</>
```

# React Refs

- React is declerative and abstracts DOM manipulations
- Gets reference on underlying DOM element
  - Access DOM element properties (e.g. height, position, ...)
- Returns object with `current` key set to DOM object or `null`
- `useRef` hook - `const ref = userRef(null)`
- `createRef` method - `this.ref = createRef(null)`

<Notes>

- React is declerative, it abstracts DOM elements and manipulations. Sometime developers need access to underlying DOM elements.
- React Refs allows access to underlying DOM elements. Access to those elements allows developers to get element height, position, to add DOM attributes, ...
- Refs can be used in class components and functional components via `useRef` hook.
- Ref will be returned in object as `current` property. `current` property is reference to DOM element or null if element is not set.
- Refs can be used inside class components (`createRef`) or inside functional components (useRef`) hook.
- Refs are commonly used with generic base components (input, button).

# Refs Forwarding

- Ref added on React component will return that React component or `undefined`
- `ref` is not available via props (same as `key`)
- Tehnique of returning underlying DOM elements form components to parent component via `ref`
- `React.forwardRef((props, ref) => JSX Markup)`

<Notes>

- Common use case is adding Ref to existing React component (e.g. `<Form ref={formRef} />`). This ref wouldn't work out of the box, at least not as expected.
  It would return React component instead of DOM element if used on class component, or `undefined` if used on functional component.
  That behaviour can be "fixed" with Forwating refs.
- `ref` cannot be accessed via props, as it is internal to React and will be stripped (i.e. same as `key` prop).
- Forwarding refs allow developers to add refs on React components and receive DOM element instead of React components.
- Components taht should return DOM elmenents as ref should be wrapped in React.forwardRef and set provided ref to desired DOM element.

# Reusability & Separation

- Often some logic can be reused or separated to single place
- Share logic between components
  - Separate logic and presentation in different places
  - Insert logic into component from other component (or function)
- React patterns (similar to Decorator Design pattern)
  - High Order Component
  - Render Props
  - Custom hooks

<Notes>

- Separation of concerns is important principle in software development
- React allows us to insert logic into component via common React patterns (which are in fact similar to Decorator design pattern):
  - Hight Order Components(HOC)
  - Render Props
  - Custom hooks
- Decorator pattern is called that because it decorates some code (component) with logic or behaviour

</Notes>

# Motivation - Example

- Separate mobile devices from desktops

<BloatedText color="orange" />

# High Order Component

- Function which receives component as argument
- Returns new component which renders provided component
  - Function that wraps provided component into new component with desired logic
- Provided component must not be mutated
- Passes handler or value to component via props
  - Problem when passed prop is already in use by component (in `props`)
- Often starts with `with*`

```react
const ComponentWithBehaviour = withBehaviour(Component => {
  // props for Component provided
  return function(props) {
    const behaviour /* value or function added to component */

    return <Component behaviour={behaviour} {...props} />
  }
})
```

<Notes>

- Function that wraps provided component into new component with desired logic.
- Component should not be mutated, it can only be decorated with new props.
- Note how `props` are spread on component provided. In props are own props for provided component.
  This is place where problems can happen if decorated prop has same name as some prop on component, as decorated prop would be overridden.
- HOC usualy have `with` prefix
- HOC are used in some popular libraries (`withRouter` in `react-router`, or `connect` in `redux`)

# High Order Component - Example

<TextWithIsMobile color="red" />

# Render Prop

- Component without conventional render
  - Receives render function as prop
- Component with logic and without presentation
  - Calls provided render with enhancements
- Render is often passed as `children` or as `render` prop

```react
// decorated component
function Component(props) {
  return <RenderPropComponent
    render={enhancements => /* do something with enhancements */}
  />
})
```

<Notes>

- Component with render method as prop (render method is provided via `children` or `render` prop)
- More declerative usage then HOC, as it is used inside component that is decorated, so prop name collision is fixed.
- Can substitute HOC and vice versa.
- Render Prop is used in some popular libraries (`render prop` in `react-router`, or `Downshift` in `downshift`)

</Notes>

# Render Prop - Example

---

# Custom Hook

- Function that is called inside functional components
  - Returns enhancements that will be used in functional components
- Uses other React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, ...)

```react
// decorated component
function Component(props) {
  const enhancements = useCustomHook()

  return /* do something with enhancements */}
})
```

<Notes>

- Ordinary function that returns some enhancements and decorates component which called it
- Cleaner syntax, easier to understand

# React Context

- Share data between components in sub tree
  - Data is passed from `Provider` to multiple `Consumer`
- Consumers receive providers value
  - When Provider value changes, its consumers will rerender
- Avoids prop drilling
- Works with class and functional components (via hook)
- `const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultContextValue)`
- `const value = useContext(MyContext)`

<Notes>

- Prop drilling - In React data is passed top-down via props.
  Prop drilling is anti-pattern when some components receive props they don't need and pass them to their children components and patterns repeats deeper into tree.
- React Context allows developers to share data between parent and multiple children. Parent is called `Provider` as it provides value for children.
  Child is called `Consumer` as it consumes provided data.
- Rules:
  - Provider has to be rendered above children (it has to be parent to children)
  - Consumer will receive data form nearest Provider of the same type (if multiple rendered).
  - When Provider value changes, all its Consumers will rerender, to get new value.
- Context works with both class and functional components. To be more specific context can be consumed in class and in functional components.
- Context is created with `createContext` function. Function receives optional defaultValue which will be used as initial context value.
  Context contains two components (that are used from the outside):
  - Provider (`MyContext.Provider`)
  - Consumer (`MyContext.Consumer`)
- Contexts are usually added to separate file and they export `Context` itself, `Provider` and `Consumer` components.

# React Portal

- Render children outside of DOM hierarchy
  - Used with modals, dialogs, notifications
- Commonly used with Singleton pattern
- ReactDOM specific
- `ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)`
- Event propagation and Context work as if it is still in hierarchy

<Notes>

- Sometimes there is use case to add some markup or component outside DOM hierarchy.
  Those use cases often include modals, dialogs, app level notifications and errors.
  It is used for components that pop out of layout (to aviod complex z-indexes)
- Singleton pattern is common as apps usually have only one element over others.
- Portal is in `reactDOM` package, so it can be used only for web applications.
- `ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)` will render child (any viable child) into provided **DOM container**.
- Markup will be in container element but event propagation and context will behave based on hierarchy.
  In example, event triggered in modal will propagate to the component that rendered Portal.
  Same rule applies to context, modal could consume providers that it could consume if it wasn't portal.
